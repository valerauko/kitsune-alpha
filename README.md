# Kitsune

Very fox microblogging.

## Status

Wildly in development. Check the [develop branch](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune/tree/develop) and the [kanban](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune/projects/1) to see progress.

Don't expect a release in master until core functionality's mostly in place.
